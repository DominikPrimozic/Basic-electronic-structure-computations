# Basic-electronic-structure-computations

This is the repository for my undergraduate thesis titled Quantum Mechanical Calculations of Simple Systems.

## Pythonic program
First i made the program outline in python, but it was too slow so i changed to c++. All the basic functionalities are in python as well.

## C++ program
I ve rewritten the program in c++ structure with boost library for gamma function and eigen for matrices and matrix solver. The program is sufficient in HF and DFT, though it could be improved. I am woring on some additions on the side such as CCSD and UHF. Overall my goal was already reached by making this program for basic computations. Feel free to test it out or improve it
